== Description ==
Convert a WordPress readme.txt file to Github README.md

then you need a Read Me file created in GitHub flavoured Mark Down.

This simple routine does that.
Use it as part of your package routine.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of the txt2md plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/txt2md' directory

```
